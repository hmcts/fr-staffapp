##Processing the updated ‘apply for help with fees’ form - a guide for staff taking part in the trial 


### An updated application form

The updated form is designed to be easier to use.

[SCREENSHOT]


The main changes are:

**changing the name from ‘fee remission’ to ‘apply for help with fees’** - many people did not understand what the word ‘remission’ meant in connection to fees.


**removing the term ‘disposable capital threshold test’** - the updated form asks applicants if they have more than £3,000 in savings. You’ll then be able to tell if they pass the ‘disposable capital threshold test’ when you’re processing the form.


**removing the terms ‘remission 1’ and ‘remission 2’** - the updated form still asks about benefits and income, but doesn’t use the terms ‘remission 1’ and remission 2’ as they were confusing for applicants.


###Benefits checker

You can now check whether an applicant is receiving one of the 6 ‘gateway benefits’ that automatically entitles them to help with their court fees.

These are:

+ Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA)
+ Income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)
+ Income Support
+ Universal Credit (and you’re earning less than £6,000)
+ State Pension (with Guarantee Credit)
+ Scottish Legal Aid


In the future applicants won’t need to bring evidence that they’re getting one of these benefits. **For the trial though, they’ll still need to bring evidence.**

If there is not enough information for the DWP check to confirm that the applicant is receiving benefits, you’ll see this message:

If you get this message, enter the information again to make sure there are no mistakes.

If you are still getting this message, ask the applicant to provide more evidence. For example, a letter confirming that they’re getting the benefits.


The system records the results of each benefits check. This means the online tool should only be used for processing application forms.


For the trial only, you’ll still need to check the evidence that the applicant has submitted.

*For remission 1 this is an official letter confirming the benefit received.*

It must show the applicant’s title, full name, address and postcode and confirm that they currently receive that benefit.

If the applicant is part of a couple who receive a shared benefit and their name is not on the shared benefit notice, they must provide evidence showing that they live at the same address as their partner.

Evidence should be in the form of an official document, such as a utility bill, and should show the applicant’s title, full name and address.

The letter must be in the following form:

| **Benefit** | **Evidence letter from** | **Dated** |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
|Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance | Job Centre Plus / Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) | No more than three months old
|Income-related Employment and Support Allowance | Job Centre Plus / Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) | No more than three months old
|Income support	 | Job Centre Plus / Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) | No more than three months old
|Universal Credit – with gross annual earnings of less than £6,000 | Job Centre Plus / Department for Work and Pensions | No more than three months old
|State Pension - Guarantee Credit | he Pension Service / Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) | Assessed Income Period should cover the current financial year
|Scottish Civil Legal Aid | Scottish Legal Aid Board | Recent letter clearly showing a grant of support for the claim which you are bringing or have brought



###Calculating the fee based on income (remission 2)


*For remission 2, the applicant still needs to provide evidence of their income.*


**Bank statements**

The applicant must give the court or tribunal their last three months’ bank statements (and those of their partner if they’re ‘part of a couple’) as well as the evidence listed below.

**Wages**
Paid employment
The applicant must give the court or tribunal copies of wage slips from all their jobs, including information about any cash-in-hand work.

**Paid monthly**
They must give their last month’s wage slip as long as it is no more than six weeks old.

**Paid weekly**
They must give their last full month of wage slips as long as they are no more than six weeks old.

**Self employment**
They must give the court or tribunal their most recent tax return (Self Assessment).

They also need to provide one of the following:

- most recent HMRC self assessment tax calculation
- other proof of current income (for example, bank statements for a business account, which show income for the last financial year)


**Other types of income**

*Child benefit*

If they’re receiving Child Benefit they must provide a Child Benefit Award Notice (Guarantee Credit), or most recent bank statement showing Child Benefit payments being paid into their account. This will confirm how much they currently receive and how often the money is paid.

*Pension*

If they are receiving a state, private or occupational pension they must give the court or tribunal a letter or statement confirming their pension payments.

*Income from people living with them*

If applicants receive money from any people living with them, for example for rent, they must provide a letter confirming the arrangement. The letter should be dated within the last month and include how much and how often they pay you.



**All other benefits**

For example:

* Working Tax Credit
* Child Tax Credit
* Maintenance Payments
* Contribution-based Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA)
* Contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)
* Universal Credit

If they’re receiving any of these benefits (or others that are not listed in question 8 and are not on the list of ‘Excluded benefits’) they must provide a benefit entitlement notice or letter. This should confirm how much is currently being received and how often the money is paid.

**Other monthly income**

If they receive any other income, for example from investments or selling goods on the internet, they must provide official evidence that shows the amount of income received, how it is received, and how often.


**When the benefits check and paper evidence don't match**

If the evidence provided by the applicant is different to the results of the benefits check, please make sure you record this in the Excel spreadsheet under this column:  b) ‘Did DWP check match paper evidence?’ (To be completed with Yes/No)

You should base your decision about accepting or rejecting an application on the paper evidence rather than the DWP check (if they are different).


**Rejecting an application**

If both the benefits check and the evidence provided by the applicant show that they’re not eligible for help with their fees, please record this in the spreadsheet, and create a letter explaining why their application has not been successful.

If the benefits checker and the paper evidence don’t match up, base your decision on the paper evidence.


**Accepting an application**

If both the benefits checker and the evidence submitted by the applicant show that they are eligible for help with their fees, then log this in the usual way.

If the benefits checker and the paper evidence don’t match up, base your decision on the paper evidence.

##Processing the updated ‘apply for help with fees’ form - a guide for staff

* [An updated application form](#an-updated-application-form)
* [Using the benefits checker](#using-the-benefits-checker)
* [Calculating the fee based on income](#calculating-the-fee-based-on-income)



###An updated application form
The updated form is designed to be easier to use. The main changes are:

**it's called ‘apply for help with fees’ rather than ‘fee remission’** - many people did not understand what the word ‘remission’ meant in connection to fees.


**there's no mention of ‘disposable capital threshold test’** - the updated form asks applicants if they have more than £3,000 in savings. You’ll then be able to tell if they pass the ‘disposable capital threshold test’ when you’re processing the form.


**applicants don't have to select ‘remission 1’ or ‘remission 2’** - the updated form still asks about benefits and income, but doesn’t use the terms ‘remission 1’ and remission 2’ to avoid confusion.


###Using the benefits checker

You can now check whether an applicant is receiving one of the 6 ‘gateway benefits’ that automatically entitles them to help with their court fees.

These are:

+ Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA)
+ Income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)
+ Income Support
+ Universal Credit (and you’re earning less than £6,000)
+ State Pension (with Guarantee Credit)
+ Scottish Legal Aid



####Signing up to use the online benefits checker

Use the online benefits checker to make sure that applicants are eligible for financial help

* You’ll get an email with a link to set up your password for the benefits checker

* Log in using your email and password

![sign in image](<%= image_url('Staff_signin.png') %>)

* Click 'Check benefits' at the top of the page

* Enter the first 3 letters of the applicant’s last name, date of birth and National Insurance number on this page

![start DWP check image](<%= image_url('DWP_startcheck.png') %>)

If you’re processing an application for a refund of a fee that’s already been paid, then enter the date in ‘Date application made’. The benefits checker can check eligibility up to 3 months in the past.

* **If an applicant started receiving benefits in the last 48 hours** then the benefits checker may not yet have the most up to date information  

####Benefits check results

**If the National Insurance number is not valid, you’ll see this message:**

![Incorrect National Insurance image](<%= image_url('DWP_undetermined.png') %>)

**If the applicant is getting one of the 6 gateway benefits, you’ll see this message:**

![Correct National Insurance image](<%= image_url('DWP_correct.png') %>)

**If the applicant is not getting one of the 6 benefits, you’ll see this message:**

![Benefits not received image](<%= image_url('DWP_notreceived.png') %>)

**If the personal details belong to someone who has died, you will see this message:**

![National Insurance deceased image](<%= image_url('DWP_deceased.png') %>)


**If there is not enough information for the DWP check to confirm that the applicant is receiving benefits, you’ll see this message:**

![Benefits undetermined image](<%= image_url('DWP_undetermined.png') %>)


If you get this message, enter the information again to make sure there are no mistakes.

If you are still getting this message, ask the applicant to provide more evidence. For example, a letter confirming that they’re getting the benefits.


The system records the results of each benefits check. This means the online tool should only be used for processing application forms.

#### You no longer need to check paper evidence for benefits

Applicants no longer need to include paper evidence to show they're receiving one of the 6 benefits. Instead, you'll be able to rely on the results of the online DWP check.

####What if the online DWP check isn't available?

The occasional technical fault may mean that the online DWP check isn't available. Usually this will be fixed quickly.

When the online check isn't available you should first of all try again later. If you're dealing with an applicant at the counter, you can ask them to return with paper evidence if this is possible.

**In an emergency**, (for example an eviction), you can ask the applicant to provide an official letter to show that they're receiving benefits.   

It must show:

+ the applicant’s title
+ full name
+ address and postcode

It must also confirm that they currently receive one of the 6 'gateway benefits'.

Alternatively you can refer the case to the court manager who may be able to grant an undertaking.   

#### What if the DWP check doesn't match what the applicant has stated?  

If the applicant has recently started receiving one of the 6 benefits (eg in the last week) then the online DWP check may not be up to date. If you're processing the application at the counter, ask the applicant to provide a paper evidence if possible.

###Calculating the fee based on income

The applicant needs to provide evidence of their income.

**Bank statements**

The applicant must give the court or tribunal their last three months’ bank statements (and those of their partner if they’re ‘part of a couple’) as well as the evidence listed below.

**Wages**
Paid employment
The applicant must give the court or tribunal copies of wage slips from all their jobs, including information about any cash-in-hand work.

**Paid monthly**
They must give their last month’s wage slip as long as it is no more than six weeks old.

**Paid weekly**
They must give their last full month of wage slips as long as they are no more than six weeks old.

**Self employment**
They must give the court or tribunal their most recent tax return (Self Assessment).

They also need to provide one of the following:

- most recent HMRC self assessment tax calculation
- other proof of current income (for example, bank statements for a business account, which show income for the last financial year)


**Other types of income**

*Child benefit*

If they’re receiving Child Benefit they must provide a Child Benefit Award Notice (Guarantee Credit), or most recent bank statement showing Child Benefit payments being paid into their account. This will confirm how much they currently receive and how often the money is paid.

*Pension*

If they are receiving a state, private or occupational pension they must give the court or tribunal a letter or statement confirming their pension payments.

*Income from people living with them*

If applicants receive money from any people living with them, for example for rent, they must provide a letter confirming the arrangement. The letter should be dated within the last month and include how much and how often they pay you.


**All other benefits**

For example:

* Working Tax Credit
* Child Tax Credit
* Maintenance Payments
* Contribution-based Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA)
* Contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)
* Universal Credit

If they’re receiving any of these benefits (or others that are not listed in question 8 and are not on the list of ‘Excluded benefits’) they must provide a benefit entitlement notice or letter. This should confirm how much is currently being received and how often the money is paid.

**Other monthly income**

If they receive any other income, for example from investments or selling goods on the internet, they must provide official evidence that shows the amount of income received, how it is received, and how often.

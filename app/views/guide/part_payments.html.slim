    p Applicants may be eligible to pay only part of their fee, depending on their income, whether they have any dependent children or if they are part of a couple.

    p The exact amount will be worked out for you and a letter generated for you to send to the applicant requesting the part fee payment.

    p The applicant will have 14 calendar days to provide payment. You won't be able to finish processing the application until you've received the part-payment.

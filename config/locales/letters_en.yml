          <li><u>Self employed</u>: your most recent tax return (Self Assessment) and HMRC Self Assessment Tax Calculation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you’re self-employed and don’t have either of these documents, you’ll need to provide bank statements that show income for the previous tax year.</p>
        <div><strong>Child Benefit, Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit</strong></div>
        <p>A letter from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) dated in the last 3 months confirming that you’re receiving Child Benefit, Working Tax Credit or Child Tax Credit.</p>
        <p>If you don’t have a Child Benefit Award Notice dated within the last three months then court staff will check your bank statements for evidence of money coming in.</p>

        <p>Official documentary evidence showing the amount of income received, by what method and how often. Note that money received from the sale of capital assets (eg family heirlooms), would normally be classified as ‘savings and investments’ rather than income.</p>
        <div><strong>Prisoner’s income</strong></div>
        <p>Prisoner Income and Expenditure Statement (PIES) showing earnings, spending, private cash and savings.</p>

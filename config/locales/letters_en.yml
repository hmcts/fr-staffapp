        <p>Your savings and investments total: %{savings_total}</p>

        <p>Dear %{full_name}</p>
        <p><strong>Your reference: %{reference}</strong></p>
        <p>We’ve received your application for help with fees. Unfortunately, we can’t help with this fee. You need to pay the full amount. This is because the Department for Work and Pensions has no record of you receiving any of the benefits that make you automatically eligible for help with fees. See list of qualifying benefits below.</p>
        <p>If you’ve started receiving any of these qualifying benefits in the last seven days, or you receive them with your partner, return your application or relevant paperwork with a full breakdown letter from the Department for Work and Pensions dated within the last 3 months, confirming the benefit received. You and your partner (if applicable) must be clearly identifiable on all documents you send and there should be evidence that your partner shares your address. If you applied for Help with Fees using an online reference number, this number is no longer valid, you will need to provide a new Help with Fees reference to court alongside your evidence.</p>
        <p>You must write your new Help with Fees reference number on any letters that you send <strong>%{reference}</strong>.</p>
        <h3 class='govuk-heading-m'>List of qualifying benefits when applying for Help with Fees</h3>

          <li>Universal Credit (<strong>and you earn less than £6,000</strong>)</li>
          <li>Pension Credit (<strong>guarantee credit</strong>)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class='govuk-heading-m'>Other benefits or low income</h3>
        <p>You may be able to get help with your fee if you’re on a low income and receive other types of benefit. There are examples of some of these types of benefits below. If you are receiving any other type of benefits, you must declare them as part of your income in a fresh Help with Fees application. Remember some parts of your benefit award may be excluded and do not need declaring for example housing element of Universal Credit.</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
         <li><strong>contribution-based</strong> Job Seekers Allowance</li>

        </ul>
        <h3 class='govuk-heading-m'>What you need to do if you are paying the fee</h3>

        <p>Dear %{full_name}</p>
        <p><strong>Reference: %{reference}</strong></p>
        <p>We received your help with fees reference code on %{application_received}. However, our records show that the code was generated more than 28 days ago.</p>
        <p>As we did not receive the help with fees reference code within the 28 days of it being generated, we’re unable to process your application. This is because your financial details need to be up-to-date upon submitting your application to the court or tribunal.</p>
        <p>You will have to pay the full fee. This may have an impact on the original case or claim related to this application.</p>
        <p>If you still want to apply for help with your fees, you will have to complete a new application with up-to-date information.</p>

        <p>We've received your application for help with fees. Before we can start work on your application, we need more information about your income.</p>

If we do not receive the requested information within <strong>28 days</strong> of our request, your help with fees application will be treated as abandoned. If your application is for a refund, this may cause a delay and as refund applications need to be received within three months of paying the fee you may no longer be eligible for a refund of your court fee.</p>

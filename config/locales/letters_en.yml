        <p>Dear %{full_name}</p>
        <p>We have received your application for help with fees. Unfortunately you’re not eligible and will have to pay the full fee. This is because you have more than the maximum amount of savings and investments allowed.
        We’ve calculated this as follows:</p>
        <p>Fee to pay:%{fee_amount}</p>
        <p>Maximum amount of savings and investments allowed: %{savings_threshold}</p>
        <p>Your savings and investments total: %{savings_total}</p>
        <p><strong>If you disagree with this decision</strong></p>
        <p>If you disagree with our decision, you can appeal to %{name_delivery_manager}, Delivery Manager at %{court_tribunal_name}. You need to do this by %{date_for_appeal}.</p>
        <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

        <p>Dear %{full_name}</p>
        <p>We have received your application for help with fees. Unfortunately you’re not eligible and will have to pay the full fee. This is because the Department for Work and Pensions did not confirm that you’re receiving one of these benefits:</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">

        </ul>
        <p><strong>If this result is unexpected</strong></p>
        <p>If you’ve started receiving benefits in the last 7 days: The Department for Work and Pensions may not have up to date information for you.
        If this is the case, return your application along with an official letter that confirms the benefits received.</p>
        <p>If you receive benefits with your partner: Return your application with a letter from the Department for Work and Pensions confirming the benefit received.
        If the benefit is in your partner’s name, you should include a letter confirming your address is the same as your partner’s.</p>
        <p>Check the name of the benefit: There are some benefits that are similarly named to the 6 qualifying benefits:</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>Contribution based Job Seekers Allowance</li>
          <li>Contribution based Employment Support Allowance</li>

        <p>Dear %{full_name}</p>

        <p>Dear %{full_name}</p>
        <p><strong>Reference: %{reference}</strong></p>
        <p>We have received your application for help with fees. Unfortunately you’re not eligible and will have to pay the full fee. This is because you have more than the maximum amount of savings and investments allowed.
        We’ve calculated this as follows:</p>
        <p>Fee to pay:%{fee_amount}</p>
        <p>Maximum amount of savings and investments allowed: %{savings_threshold}</p>
        <p>Your savings and investments total: %{savings_total}</p>
        <p><strong>If you disagree with this decision</strong></p>
        <p>If you disagree with our decision, you can appeal to %{name_delivery_manager}, Delivery Manager at %{court_tribunal_name}. You need to do this by %{date_for_appeal}.</p>
        <p>You must write your reference number<strong> %{reference}</strong> on any letters that you send.</p>

        <p><strong>Reference: %{reference}</strong></p>
        <p>We have received your application for help with fees. Unfortunately you’re not eligible and will have to pay the full fee. This is because the Department for Work and Pensions did not confirm that you’re receiving one of these benefits:</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA)</li>
          <li>income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)</li>
          <li>Income Support</li>

          <li>Pension Credit (guarantee credit)</li>
<li>Scottish Civil Legal Aid</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>If this result is unexpected</strong></p>
        <p>If you’ve started receiving benefits in the last 7 days: the Department for Work and Pensions may not have up to date information for you.
        If this is the case, return your application along with an official letter that confirms the benefits received.</p>
        <p>If you receive benefits with your partner: return your application with a letter from the Department for Work and Pensions confirming the benefit received.
        If the benefit is in your partner’s name, you should include a letter confirming your address is the same as your partner’s.</p>
<p>You must write your reference number<strong> %{reference}</strong> on any letters that you send.</p>
        <p>Check the name of the benefit: There are some benefits that are similarly named to the 6 qualifying benefits:</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>contribution-based Job Seekers Allowance</li>
          <li>contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance</li>
          <li>Pension Credit (savings credit)</li>
          <li>Universal Credit and you earn over £6,000 a year (before tax and National Insurance)</li>
          <li>Scottish Legal Aid Advice and Assistance</li>
          <li>Scottish Legal Aid Advice by Way of Representation (ABWOR)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Dear %{full_name}</p>
        <p>We have received your application for help with fees. Unfortunately you’re not eligible and will have to pay the full fee. This is because the National Insurance number that you provided appears to belong to someone who has died.</p>

        <p>Check the National Insurance number: Make sure that you have provided the correct National Insurance number. If it’s correct then you will need to contact the Department for Work and Pensions to update the information they hold on record for you.</p>
